  Founded in Istanbul in 2011 to bring together academics, researchers and
  intellectuals to demonstrate the consistency of the universal values of
  religious, economic and political freedom with Islam, ILN has a noteworthy
  record in terms of organizing a number of scientific, cultural and
  intellectual activities within a relatively short period of time. This is
  admirable for a young NGO which is just 12 years old to organize 9
  international conferences in a number of Muslim countries including Morocco,
  Pakistan, Malaysia, Indonesia and Türkiye; conducting 3 summer workshops
  (Iran, Tunisia, Pakistan); publishing 3 important books on Islam, freedom and
  open markets; and releasing many webinars and podcasts on various issues.
