  For many years the Islam and Liberty Network has been striving to restore the
  intellectual curiosity and openness to other cultures that was characteristic
  of Islam at the height of its golden age. The success of this endeavor is
  vital if we are to witness the emergence of a just, peaceful and truly global
  civilization, whose constituent elements retain their distinctive
  characteristics.
