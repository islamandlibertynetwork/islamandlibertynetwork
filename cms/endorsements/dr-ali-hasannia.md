  Thank you ILN for inspiring and motivating me to focus on the concept of
  liberty in Muslim-majority countries! After attending the 6th ILN Conference
  in Islamabad in 2018, I couldn't have imagined how that event may affect my
  future activities. I realized that something must change in my research
  career. Upon coming back home to Iran, I decided to make a plan regarding
  problems inside Muslim communities in Iran as far as liberty is concerned.
  After some consultations with my colleagues, I wrote a research proposal and
  started a series of researches in collaboration with some students. Many of
  the articles I wrote got published! I also attended 2 other ILN conferences as
  a speaker and I hope I can continue this way. I am really grateful for ILN and
  its powerful team for motivating me.
